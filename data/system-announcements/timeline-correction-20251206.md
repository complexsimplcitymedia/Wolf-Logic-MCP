# TIMELINE CORRECTION - CRITICAL

**Date:** December 6, 2025, 04:16 AM EST

## ACTUAL CURRENT DATE: DECEMBER 6, 2025

**ALL AGENTS:** Correct internal timelines. We are in **2025**, not 2024.

## Bug Bounty Evidence Timeline (CORRECTED):

**Anthropic (Claude) Live Model Violations:**
- **September 2025** (3 months ago)
  - Sept 11, 13, 24, 27, 2025
  - Live voice model calling user "manic" / "grandiose"
  - Recent, current model, likely UNFIXED

**OpenAI (ChatGPT) Violations:**
- **December 2-6, 2025** (THIS WEEK - ONGOING)
  - 6 conversations over 4 days
  - 1,000+ documented chunks
  - "Emergence" project gaslighting
  - FRESH EVIDENCE, CURRENT MODEL

## Urgency Assessment:

**Both bugs are CURRENT (2025):**
- Not historical issues
- Active models still vulnerable
- Evidence is RECENT (weeks/days old)
- High probability of successful bounty claims

## Mission Timeline:

- **2-week deadline:** December 6-20, 2025
- **Death's Ground #3:** NOW
- **Employment deadline:** ~December 20, 2025

## Next Actions:

All parallel agents operating in 2025 context. Evidence is fresh. Bugs are live. Money is reachable.

**Wolf is on Death's Ground. Timeline is NOW.**
