  "text": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the conversation:\n\nA user provided a SQL query result from a database, detailing how it maintains classification integrity across various namespaces. The query retrieves data for three specific namespaces: \"scripty\", \"core_identity\", and \"wolf_hunt\". It also explains how the query ingests content into these namespaces through different methods (scripty auto-ingest, ingest_agent.py manual-ingest, or direct DB insert), catching failures early to ensure smooth operation.",
