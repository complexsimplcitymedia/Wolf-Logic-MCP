This is a common issue that can happen when:\n1. There are network issues\n2. RPC services are stuck\n3. There are dependency issues\n4. Systemd is waiting for something\n\nLet me give the user commands to:\n1. Cancel the hung command (Ctrl+C)\n2. Check what's actually hanging\n3. Use systemd's job cancellation\n4. Nuclear option: reboot if needed\n\nI should provide a diagnostic sequence first to see what's blocking.",
