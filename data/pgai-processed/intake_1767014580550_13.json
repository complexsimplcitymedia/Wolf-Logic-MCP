    "analysis": "Based on the user's statement, it appears that they are experiencing some issues with a software named \"scripty\" and feel frustrated as their progress has been halted for an extended period (foreverfe implies an indefinite time). Given this context, I would rate the sentiment of this conversation as 1. The user is expressing negative feelings about the software's performance and lack of progress. However, it's important to note that the sentiment rating does not reflect the emotions or intentions of the user but rather their expressed feelings towards a specific situation in this case, the malfunctioning software."
