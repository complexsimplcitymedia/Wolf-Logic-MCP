    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is rated as 2, leaning towards a negative tone. The user's response appears agitated and disrespectful, which indicates dissatisfaction or frustration. The word \"obviously\" suggests that they expect an obvious solution, but the sarcasm and profanity indicate annoyance with the assistance provided so far. However, it's important to note that understanding the full context of a conversation is crucial for accurate sentiment analysis, as this exchange might be part of a larger interaction where the user has been facing difficulties or misunderstandings."
