    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "Based on the provided context, it is difficult to determine the sentiment as there is no explicit emotional expression from either party in this conversation. The statement \"[Request interrupted by user for tool use]\" seems neutral and does not indicate a positive or negative sentiment. However, if we consider the common behavior in conversations, interrupting someone might be perceived as slightly negative, but it's also acceptable when it involves urgent matters like tool usage. So, I would rate this conversation a 3, leaning slightly towards neutral."
