  "text": "Here is a summary of our conversation in 2-3 sentences:\n\nA user mentioned that the `100.64.0.0/10` IP range, which covers all Tailscale IPs, was originally set to allow all mesh nodes to connect and has been modified to only allow access from specific machines. The original reason for this change is unclear, but it's intended to provide tighter security. The user also offered alternative settings, including `100.110.0/16` and `100.110.82.0/24`, which would allow more control over who can access each machine.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: The `100.64.0.0/10` in pg_hba.conf is the **Tailscale CGNAT range** - it covers all Tailscale IPs (100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255).\n\nYour actual Tailscale IPs are `100.110.x.x` which falls within that range.\n\n**Where it came from:** Someone configured it in pg_hba.conf to allow all Tailscale mesh nodes to connect.\n\n**If you want tighter security**, you could change it to:\n- `100.110.0.0/16` - only your tailnet (100.110.x.x)\n- `100.110.82.0/24` - only your specific subnet\n\nYour current nodes:\n```\n100.110.82.181  csmcloud-server (this machine)\n100.110.82.245  command-center\n100.110.82.250  debian-wolf-logic-node\n100.110.81.245  apexwolf-macbookpro\n```\n\nThe current `/10` setting is fine - only machines on your Tailscale mesh can reach those IPs anyway. Tailscale itself is the firewall.",
