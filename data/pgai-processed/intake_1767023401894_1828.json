However, if we assume that the user's intention was to initiate a conversation or request assistance, then we can infer a neutral sentiment (3) since the system responded with a default message.\n\nA more positive interaction would include the system providing helpful information or solving the user's problem, while a negative interaction might involve the system failing to understand or respond appropriately to the user's input."
