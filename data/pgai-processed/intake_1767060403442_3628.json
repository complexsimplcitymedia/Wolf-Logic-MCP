This information is technical in nature and does not convey any sentiment. Therefore, it's difficult to rate the conversation from 1-5 as it doesn't reflect emotions or attitudes typically associated with those ratings.\n\nHowever, if we consider the context, a user providing such details might suggest they are troubleshooting or configuring network settings, which could imply a neutral to slightly positive sentiment (3) as they are actively engaging in problem-solving or setup activities."
