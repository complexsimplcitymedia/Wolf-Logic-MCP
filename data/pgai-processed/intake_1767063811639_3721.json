    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "In this particular interaction, there is no explicit sentiment as it is a command given to a tool named \"TodoWrite\", which seems to be a task management application. However, the tone is formal and neutral, indicating a professional or structured environment. I would rate the sentiment as 3, leaning towards being informative rather than positive or negative.\n\nIt's important to note that when assessing sentiment in conversations between humans, context plays a crucial role in determining whether the interaction is positive, negative, or neutral. In this case, there is no human response to analyze, and the conversation consists of just one command given to a tool."
