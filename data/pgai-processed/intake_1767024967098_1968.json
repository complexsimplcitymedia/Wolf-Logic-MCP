    "analysis": "In this particular case, there is no sentiment involved as the text provided is a command for a Bash tool, which is a type of shell used in operating systems like Linux. The sentiment rating doesn't apply to technical commands or instructions. However, if we were to rate the usefulness or friendliness, it could be around 4.5 since it provides clear and concise instructional information."
