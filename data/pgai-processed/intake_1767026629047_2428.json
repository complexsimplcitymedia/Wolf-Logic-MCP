The user is trying to find some files but was met with a response that no files were found, which can be perceived as disappointing or frustrating. However, the neutral aspect comes from the fact that there's no personal emotion or context in the conversation to further enhance the sentiment one way or another.\n\nRating: 2 (slightly negative)"
