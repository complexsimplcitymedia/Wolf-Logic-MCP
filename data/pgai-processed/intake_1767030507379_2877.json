    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this statement is generally neutral but leans slightly positive. The use of the term \"Prometheus reloaded\" suggests a reference to a well-known tool (Prometheus) being updated or used in a new way, which can be interpreted as innovative and potentially positive. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact sentiment towards PostgreSQL dashboard importing to Grafana. A rating of 3 seems appropriate for this statement, as it's neither very negative nor very positive but rather informative about a technical process."
