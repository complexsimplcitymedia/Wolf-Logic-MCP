    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment in this exchange is neutral to slightly negative, as the user expresses frustration due to a perceived lack of responsiveness or understanding from the other party (not explicitly stated but implied). However, there is no explicit use of insults or strong negative language, which keeps it from being rated very negative.\n\nThe user's message suggests dissatisfaction and a feeling that their concerns are not being addressed, often indicative of a deteriorating relationship or communication between the parties involved. A follow-up response addressing the user's concern could help improve the sentiment in future interactions.\n\nRating: 2/5 (slightly negative)"
