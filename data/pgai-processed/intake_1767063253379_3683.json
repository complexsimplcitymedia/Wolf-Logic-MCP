  "text": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of our conversation:\n\nThis conversation has started with an introduction about implementing Authentik, a service for Single Sign-On (SSO) protection, and the discovery of that it's already installed and configured. The setup appears to be on track, as there are API tokens in place and an OpenAPI spec defining OAuth2/JWT/API key schemes. However, before proceeding with implementation, you'd like to confirm that Authentik SSO is being used for endpoints protected by this set-up.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: Good context. Authentik is installed, API token exists in `/api/.env`, and the OpenAPI spec already defines OAuth2/JWT/API Key schemes - but none are implemented. The Friday launch checklist mentions \"Authentik SSO protecting endpoints.\"\n\nBefore I design the implementation:",
