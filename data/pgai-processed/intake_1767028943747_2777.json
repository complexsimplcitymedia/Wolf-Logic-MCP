However, there is an issue with the `wolf-logic` package due to missing dependencies in its Python SDK directory, which is expected at `/../wolf-logic`. The Assistant suggests showing the full bridge configuration or helping fix the missing dependency, but prioritizing getting PostgreSQL back online first to restore the Librarian service.\\n(5 rows)', 'is_error': False}]",

  "sentiment": {
    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is predominantly neutral, leaning slightly towards negative due to the failure of a script (fido2-alert.sh) and the mention of an error with an exit code 2. However, it's important to note that without more context, we cannot definitively determine the user's emotional state or overall sentiment.\n\nIn terms of a brief summary:\n1. The user is running a script named fido2-alert.sh, but it has failed with an exit code 2.\n2. The user is being asked for a password to continue with sudo command execution (indicating that the failure might be related to authentication or permissions).\n3. The interaction so far seems focused on resolving the script failure and granting necessary permissions."
