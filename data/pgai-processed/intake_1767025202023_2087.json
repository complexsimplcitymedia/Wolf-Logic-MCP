The issue can be resolved by changing the `listen_addresses` configuration from `'localhost,100.110.82.181'` to `'*'`, which listens on all available network interfaces.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: **ROOT CAUSE FOUND:**\n\nTailscale interface isn't visible (sandbox restriction or Tailscale is down). PostgreSQL config requires `100.110.82.181` to bind TCP - if that IP isn't available at startup, **TCP binding fails entirely**.\n\n**THE FIX:** Change `listen_addresses` from `'localhost,100.110.82.181'` to `'*'` (listen on all interfaces).",
