    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation snippet, it appears that the user is attempting to use a tool (Caddy) but received a response indicating that there is no native Caddy available. This could potentially lead to frustration or negativity, hence I would rate this interaction as a 2. The sentiment isn't very positive because the user is unable to accomplish their intended task, but it's not particularly negative either since the error message indicates that the issue might be related to the tool's availability rather than an unrecoverable error."
