  "text": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of our conversation:\n\nWe discussed a script that creates an NFS export for data on a remote machine and mounts it to a local directory, as well as instructions for adding the NFS export to the system's export file. The script also provides automated procedures for restarting the NFS server and mounting the exported data on a local network. Additionally, the script includes steps for dropping transcripts of the mounted data onto a specific location on the local machine.",
