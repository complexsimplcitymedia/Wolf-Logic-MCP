Therefore, it is difficult to accurately rate the sentiment. However, if we consider that the system is successfully processing files without errors, we can infer that the interaction might lean slightly positive (4) as the user or the system seems satisfied with the outcome. But again, this is an assumption based on the context provided and actual sentiment may vary depending on the broader context of the application."
