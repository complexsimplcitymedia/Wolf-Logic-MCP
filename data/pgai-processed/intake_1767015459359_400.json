    "analysis": "Given that the user's message indicates an interruption or cancellation of a previous request, without any additional context or explicit sentiment, it is difficult to assign a numerical sentiment score. However, the interruption could be interpreted as a neutral action, neither positive nor negative, since it is simply a response to a situation rather than expressing feelings about it. A more precise sentiment analysis would require further discussion or specific phrases indicating positive or negative emotions."
