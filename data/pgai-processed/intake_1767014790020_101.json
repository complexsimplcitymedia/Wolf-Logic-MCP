  "text": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of the conversation:\n\nAn assistant found that the `scripty/` directory and its contents are empty, causing scripty to not capture any data. Similarly, the `data/client-dumps/` directory does not exist or is empty, further explaining why scripty cannot capture data. The assistant suggests two options: checking if the scripts are located elsewhere in the repo or rebuilding scripty from scratch.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: **FOUND THE PROBLEM:**\n\nThe `scripty/` directory in this repo is **EMPTY** - no Python scripts. That's why scripty isn't capturing.\n\n`data/client-dumps/` also doesn't exist or is empty.\n\nThe scripty scripts got deleted or moved. Do you want me to:\n1. Check if they're in a different location in this repo?\n2. Rebuild scripty from scratch in this repo?",
