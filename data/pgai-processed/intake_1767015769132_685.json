Therefore, it's not possible to accurately rate the sentiment as 1 (very negative) or 5 (very positive). However, if we assume that the user's silence could potentially indicate neutrality or indifference, then the sentiment might lean slightly towards neutral. But this is just an assumption and a more complete conversation would be needed for a definitive sentiment analysis."
