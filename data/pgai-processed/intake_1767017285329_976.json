    "score": 2,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation can be rated as 2. The user is encountering an error with a script, which suggests frustration or annoyance. However, the error message itself does not convey overly negative emotions but rather provides technical information about the issue. The password prompt and requirement for a terminal indicate a problem that needs to be resolved in order for the user to continue with their task. So while there's some degree of inconvenience, it's not extreme enough to warrant a rating lower than 2 on a scale of 1-5 (1 being very negative)."
