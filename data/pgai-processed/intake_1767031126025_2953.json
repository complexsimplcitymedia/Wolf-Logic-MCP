While there is no direct display of sentiment, the assistant's statement is informative and helpful in nature.\n\nHowever, the user may perceive the situation as slightly negative because they are encountering a problem that requires additional steps to fix. In this context, I would rate the sentiment as 3, which implies a neutral-leaning-towards-slightly-negative tone due to the need for the user to take action to resolve the issue.\n\nThe assistant's message is informative and guides the user through the process of adding the necessary Debian repositories and using sudo to install openvpn, which ultimately leads to a positive outcome."
