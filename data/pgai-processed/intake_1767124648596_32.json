    "analysis": "The provided statement, \"it's a system config,\" is neutral and does not convey any specific sentiment. It is simply stating a fact about a system configuration. However, the sentiment can vary depending on the context in which it is used. If it is part of a troubleshooting process or repair conversation, it might indicate a technical or negative tone. On the other hand, if it is part of a setup or installation discussion, it could suggest a positive or informative tone. Overall, without additional context, it is best to rate this statement as neutral (3) in terms of sentiment."
