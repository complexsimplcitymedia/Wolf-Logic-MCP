    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation snippet, it appears to be a technical interaction related to API addresses rather than a sentiment-laden conversation. Therefore, it's challenging to assign a sentiment score in this context. However, if we consider that the lack of error indicates a successful interaction, we can infer a neutral-positive sentiment (3) as the user seems satisfied with the tool's response without any errors. This analysis might not be entirely accurate given the limited context, but it's the best assessment based on the information provided."
