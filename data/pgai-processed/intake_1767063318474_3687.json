    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is neutral as it primarily focuses on discussing a technical solution without expressing strong emotional feelings. However, if we consider the context of a professional discussion, it can be perceived positively since the assistant is taking initiative and offering a solution.\n\nThe assistant suggests using Authentik OIDC (OpenID Connect) for all endpoints, which indicates a secure and modern approach to user authentication. The assistant also offers to design the implementation, demonstrating a proactive attitude and willingness to help. Therefore, I would rate this conversation as 4 out of 5, as it is quite positive given the technical context."
