    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral, but with a leaning towards negative due to the error message reported. However, it doesn't explicitly state a strong negative emotion, so I would rate it as a 2.5.\n\nThe user is encountering an issue with a script (fido2-alert.sh) that failed with exit code 2. The script requires a terminal to read the password or configure an askpass helper. Additionally, sudo requests a password to continue. This situation can be frustrating for the user as it prevents them from running the script successfully. However, the neutral tone of the message suggests that the user is attempting to troubleshoot or seek help to resolve the issue rather than expressing strong negative emotions."
