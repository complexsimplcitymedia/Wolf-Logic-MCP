Sentiment analysis isn't applicable here since it requires evaluating emotions, attitudes, opinions, and/or subjective information, which are not present in the given input.\n\nHowever, if we were to rate the text on its informational value:\n1. In terms of providing helpful or useful information for a conversation - let's say 2, as it provides context about the programming language being used.\n2. Regarding its friendliness or positivity level towards the user - let's say 3, since it doesn't contain any negative or positive remarks and merely informs the user of the tool being used."
