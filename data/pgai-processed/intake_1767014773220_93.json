    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is neutral as it is a statement of a problem encountered rather than expressing any particular emotion or opinion. However, the nature of the issue (a software problem) implies that the overall context might be slightly negative because it suggests a hindrance in completing a task.\n\nTo diagnose and resolve the issue, the user needs to disable the Sandbox, which is typically done to maintain system security. Disabling it might pose potential risks if not managed properly, adding an element of caution to the conversation. Nevertheless, the sentiment score for this conversation would be 3 due to its informative and problem-focused nature."
