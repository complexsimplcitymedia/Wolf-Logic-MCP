    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral (3). The assistant is providing information and intending to help resolve an issue. However, the tone is formal and informative, which may be perceived as slightly impersonal or business-like.\n\nThe assistant explains that PostgREST is running standalone outside the provided compose file and plans to create a new compose file with JWT auth (JSON Web Token authentication). This response shows problem-solving and technical competence, which contribute to a neutral sentiment."
