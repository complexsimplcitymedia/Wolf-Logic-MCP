    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The given text does not contain any explicit emotional content, so it's challenging to assign a sentiment score based solely on this statement. However, since the text seems to describe a technical action related to software development or system administration (adding something to Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit), I would rate the sentiment as 3, indicating a neutral but informative tone. The lack of positive or negative words makes it difficult to label it as very positive or very negative."
