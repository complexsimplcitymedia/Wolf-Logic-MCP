    "analysis": "In the provided context, there is no sentiment to analyze as the statement is a simple mention of a tool called \"Bash\", which is a Unix shell and scripting language. It doesn't express any sentiment, so it would be rated as neutral (3).\n\nHowever, if we were to assume a broader conversation context where someone might be frustrated with using Bash, the sentiment could potentially be negative (1-2). But without additional information or a specific conversation, this is just an assumption."
