    "analysis": "The provided text doesn't contain a conversation between two parties, but rather it seems to be a reference to a tool named \"Edit.\" In this context, it is challenging to assign a sentiment score as there are no emotional or subjective statements. However, if we consider the neutrality of the statement, I would rate it as 3 out of 5, indicating a neutral sentiment. The tool's name does not suggest any specific positive or negative connotation. If a conversation is added that demonstrates the use of this tool and its impact on people, then sentiment analysis can be more accurate."
