    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it is difficult to determine the sentiment as it primarily discusses technical details about adding a REST API with Swagger UI. However, the user has been informed of changes made and instructions for potential future actions. The message is informative rather than positive or negative, so I would rate it as 3, which signifies a neutral sentiment.\n\nThe message might be perceived as slightly confusing due to its technical nature and the mention of several files being created, but overall, it does not convey a negative sentiment."
