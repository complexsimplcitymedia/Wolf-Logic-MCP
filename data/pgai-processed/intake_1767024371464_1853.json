    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment in this statement is neutral as it's simply stating a fact or action. There's no emotional tone or personal bias involved, making the rating 3 out of 5. However, if we imagine a context where the bot is meant to be friendly and conversational, a more positive sentiment could be implied, perhaps reflecting eagerness or readiness (4 out of 5). But in this case, it's just following instructions without expressing any particular emotion."
