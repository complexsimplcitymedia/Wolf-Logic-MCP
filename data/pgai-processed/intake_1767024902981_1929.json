The text only states a tool named \"Glob.\" However, if we assume that \"Glob\" is a helpful and efficient software or tool, it could be rated positively (4-5) because it implies productivity and ease of use. But to accurately rate its sentiment based on this information alone would require contextual understanding from previous interactions or feedback about the tool."
