    "analysis": "Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the sentiment as there is no conversation between two parties to analyze. However, if we assume that \"Read\" could be interpreted as a tool or function designed to read something, then the neutral or informative nature of this statement would rate it a 3 on the sentiment scale (1 being very negative and 5 being very positive). This rating reflects the fact that while there's no emotional context or explicit positivity or negativity in the statement, it does provide useful information about the tool's function."
