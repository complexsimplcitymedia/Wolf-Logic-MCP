    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral as it mainly consists of technical information rather than expressing feelings or opinions. However, the statement could be perceived as slightly negative because the phrase \"Sandbox blocking\" implies some sort of restriction or limitation, but providing a solution (\"Let me update to use localhost\") suggests an attempt to resolve the issue.\n\nOverall rating: 2.5/5 (Neutral with a slight hint of negativity)"
