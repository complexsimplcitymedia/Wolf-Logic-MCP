    "analysis": "The provided text does not contain a conversation but rather just mentions a tool (\"Read\"). Therefore, I cannot analyze the sentiment of a conversation in this case. However, if we consider the term \"read\" as a neutral action, I would rate it as 3 (neutral) since there's no positive or negative connotation associated with it in this context."
