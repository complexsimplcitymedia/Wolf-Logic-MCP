Since there is no sentiment expressed in this statement, it's difficult to assign a rating. However, if we assume that the statement is neutral and informative, I would rate it as 3 (neutral). The sentiment of the text does not indicate positivity or negativity towards a particular entity or emotion. It simply states the tool used for the response."
