    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral to slightly positive. The user is showing support for the other person by acknowledging a previous issue (getting a backup) and suggesting a solution (installing PostgREST). However, the interaction is brief and lacks emotional expressions, which contributes to its neutral tone. A rating of 3 would be appropriate."
