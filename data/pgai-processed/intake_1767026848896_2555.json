  "text": "Here is a summary of our conversation in 2-3 sentences:\n\nYou are referencing a `pg_hba.conf` file that specifies the IP range for Tailscale's connection gateway (CGNAT), which includes all Tailscale IP addresses from `100.64.0.0` to `100.127.255.255`. This is currently set to cover both the default Tailscale mesh nodes and other machines on your network, but can be adjusted for tighter security by specifying a different subnet or prefix length.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: The `100.64.0.0/10` in pg_hba.conf is the **Tailscale CGNAT range** - it covers all Tailscale IPs (100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255).\n\nYour actual Tailscale IPs are `100.110.x.x` which falls within that range.\n\n**Where it came from:** Someone configured it in pg_hba.conf to allow all Tailscale mesh nodes to connect.\n\n**If you want tighter security**, you could change it to:\n- `100.110.0.0/16` - only your tailnet (100.110.x.x)\n- `100.110.82.0/24` - only your specific subnet\n\nYour current nodes:\n```\n100.110.82.181  csmcloud-server (this machine)\n100.110.82.245  command-center\n100.110.82.250  debian-wolf-logic-node\n100.110.81.245  apexwolf-macbookpro\n```\n\nThe current `/10` setting is fine - only machines on your Tailscale mesh can reach those IPs anyway. Tailscale itself is the firewall.",
