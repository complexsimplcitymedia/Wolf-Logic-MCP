    "analysis": "Based on the provided context, the conversation appears to be a user giving a warning about automated responses from a system. Since the conversation doesn't contain any explicit emotional content, it's difficult to assign a sentiment score. However, considering the cautionary tone, I would rate it as slightly neutral (around 3) as the user is merely setting boundaries rather than expressing positive or negative sentiments."
