    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "Based on the content of the conversation, the sentiment appears to be neutral (around 3). The assistant is merely providing instructions and asking for a response, which is typical in a technical support context. However, it lacks elements that would suggest a positive or negative emotion, such as encouragement, frustration, or enthusiasm.\n\nHere's a brief explanation: The assistant is waiting for the user to complete a task (running a command), and once done, they will proceed with installing PostgREST. This implies a professional and task-oriented approach, which results in a neutral sentiment."
