    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation appears to be somewhat negative, with a rating of 2 out of 5. The user expresses frustration that the other party (assumed to be a person or system they are interacting with) is not listening to them. This can create tension and dissatisfaction, as effective communication is essential for mutual understanding and resolution. However, it's important to note that this is just one message in a larger conversation, so a more accurate sentiment analysis would require considering the entire context."
