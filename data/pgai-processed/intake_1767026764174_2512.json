A rating of 2 might be appropriate as the user's message doesn't express extreme emotions but rather a problem that needs resolution.\n\nHowever, the conversation could potentially become more positive if the issue gets addressed and resolved efficiently by providing the user with effective solutions or troubleshooting steps."
