    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral. It is a technical response providing information about the status of several processes and memory usage, which does not inherently express positivity or negativity. However, the inclusion of \"since we started\" suggests a positive progression as there has been an increase in memory (+1,124). Therefore, I would rate this conversation a 3 on a scale of 1-5, leaning slightly towards positive due to the mentioned progress."
