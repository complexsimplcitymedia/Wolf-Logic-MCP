    "analysis": "In this specific context, there is no sentiment as such, since Bash is a command-line shell language used in operating systems like Linux, Unix, and others. It's not expressing any emotions or attitudes. However, if we were to rate the usefulness of the statement for someone seeking information about emotional analysis, it might be closer to 1 as it doesn't provide any help regarding the sentiment analysis task."
