Since no official Linux client/app exists for IPVanish, the main way to connect is by downloading the OVPN configuration files and connecting through Network Manager or by setting up an OpenVPN connection.\\n\\n### Installation Methods\\n\\n**Method 1: Using OpenVPN (Command Line)**\\n\\nOpen the terminal and enter the command `sudo apt-get install openvpn` to install OpenVPN on your system.(no content)First, log in to your IPVanish account on their official website.

Click \"Import from file\" on the Add VPN window.\\n\\n### Requirements\\n\\nOpenVPN and systemd-resolved should be installed on your Linux system.(no content)The VPN interface should be named \\'tun0\\'.\\n\\n### Auto-Start on Boot\\n\\nYou can create a systemd service to automatically start the VPN connection on boot.\\n\\n### Recent User Experience (2025)\\n\\nOne user shared their experience in February 2025, stating they have been using IPVanish for about 2 years with no complaints about the service, though they struggled for months to configure IPVanish with OpenVPN.(no content)They eventually achieved success and were able to repeat the configuration on multiple devices.\\n\\n### Third-Party GUI Client\\n\\nFor the third-party GUI client, you can start the app through a terminal with `python3 ipvanish.py`, and download the necessary configuration files in the Configs tab first.\\n\\n\\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.'}]",
