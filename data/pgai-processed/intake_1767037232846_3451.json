However, there is an issue with the `wolf-logic` package due to missing dependencies in its Python SDK directory, which is expected at `/../wolf-logic`. The Assistant suggests showing the full bridge configuration or helping fix the missing dependency, but prioritizing getting PostgreSQL back online first to restore the Librarian service.\\n(5 rows)', 'is_error': False}]",
