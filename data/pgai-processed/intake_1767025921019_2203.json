  "text": "Here is a summary of our conversation in 2-3 sentences:\n\nYou have enabled MagicDNS on your Tailscale system and configured it to route local hosts to external IP addresses. You can also configure PostgreSQL to connect using the `librarian` hostname instead of the short alias provided by Tailscale, or use a different naming scheme for the database host. Additionally, you mentioned setting up a separate `librarian` hostname for the database in future conversations, but didn't ask about it at this time.",

Your addresses:\n\n**Tailscale MagicDNS:**\n- `csmcloud-server.vulture-broadnose.ts.net` \u2192 100.110.82.181\n\n**Local (from /etc/hosts):**\n- `csmcloud-server` \u2192 ::1 (localhost)\n\nFor PostgreSQL, you could add a shorter alias to `/etc/hosts`:\n```bash\necho \"100.110.82.181 librarian librarian.wolf\" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts\n```\n\nThen connect with:\n```bash\nPGPASSWORD=wolflogic2024 psql -h librarian -p 5433 -U wolf -d wolf_logic\n```\n\nOr use the full Tailscale name from any machine on your mesh:\n```\nlibrarian.vulture-broadnose.ts.net:5433\n```\n\nWant me to set up a `librarian` hostname for the DB, or use a different naming scheme?",
