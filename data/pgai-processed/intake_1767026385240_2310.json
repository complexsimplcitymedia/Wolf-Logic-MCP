    "score": 2,
    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it appears that the user is encountering an error while running a script (`fido2-alert.sh`) with a non-zero exit code (2). This suggests some form of failure or issue in the execution of the command, which can be viewed as somewhat negative.\n\nHowever, there's no explicit sentiment about the user's feelings towards the error itself. The user is simply stating the facts and asking for a password to continue with the `sudo` command. Therefore, I would rate this conversation a 2 on the positive-negative scale since it indicates an issue but does not express frustration or negativity in the user's message."
