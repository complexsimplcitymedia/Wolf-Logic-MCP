  "text": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of our conversation:\n\nOur conversation started with a discussion about a PostgreSQL service issue, where the `listen_addresses` configuration was not being updated correctly due to a restart requirement. To resolve this, we needed to restart the PostgreSQL service using the command `sudo systemctl restart postgresql@18-main.service`. After restarting the service, the bind address should now be set for all interfaces and the service would remain active during reboots.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: Config is fixed (`listen_addresses = '*'`) but PostgreSQL wasn't restarted. The service needs a restart for the change to take effect:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart postgresql@18-main.service\n```\n\nThen it'll bind to all interfaces and stay up through reboots.",
