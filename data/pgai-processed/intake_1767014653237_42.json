The user's message suggests a frustration or concern about the \"repo\" (repository) not functioning properly and leaving it. A rating of 2 seems appropriate, as the message indicates a problem or issue but does not express intense emotions. The user is stating a fact or problem rather than expressing positive or negative sentiment towards the repository itself."
