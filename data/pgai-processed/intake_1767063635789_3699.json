    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it appears that the user is experiencing an issue with Authentik not running. They suggest deploying locally, which indicates a problem but also a proactive approach to resolve it.\n\nI would rate this sentiment as a 3. The user's response shows some frustration due to the technical issue but also determination to find a solution. This is a neutral-leaning-towards-positive sentiment as the user is taking steps to address the problem."
