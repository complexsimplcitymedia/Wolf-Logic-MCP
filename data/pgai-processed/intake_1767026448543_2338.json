Therefore, it's not possible to rate the sentiment of this conversation. However, if we consider the absence of negative or positive statements, we could assume that the sentiment might lean towards neutral (3) on the scale of 1-5 (1=very negative, 5=very positive). This is just an assumption and the actual sentiment might vary depending on the context of the conversation."
