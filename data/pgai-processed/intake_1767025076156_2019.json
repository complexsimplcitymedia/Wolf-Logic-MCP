    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is leaning towards a 3. The user expresses frustration about the recurring issue of binding TCP and desires a long-term solution rather than a temporary fix (restart). However, the assistant's response shows an attempt to address the user's concern by promising to investigate the cause of the problem, which demonstrates some level of responsiveness. The tone could be perceived as neutral or slightly positive if we focus on the assistant's intent to help. Nonetheless, it seems the user might still feel somewhat annoyed due to the ongoing issue."
