    "analysis": "Based on the given context, there is no sentiment expressed in the conversation as it primarily involves instructions and warnings rather than opinions or emotions. However, if we assume a neutral sentiment for such text, I would rate this conversation a 3, as it falls into the middle range between positive and negative sentiments. The user's message is informative and clear, but without personal feelings or enthusiasm. The additional context provided about not responding to the messages keeps the sentiment neutral, as it is simply emphasizing the automated nature of the communication."
