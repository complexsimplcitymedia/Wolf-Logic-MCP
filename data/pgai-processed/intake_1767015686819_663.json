    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "Based on the provided text, it is not possible to determine the sentiment as the conversation appears to be a request or instruction rather than an expression of feelings. However, if we consider the fact that the user is requesting something (presumably for a tool), this could be seen as neutral since it doesn't inherently express positive or negative emotions. A rating of 3 might be appropriate for this context as it suggests a straightforward and functional interaction."
