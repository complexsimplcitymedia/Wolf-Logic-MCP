    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it appears to be a technical discussion about DNS names and settings. The content does not contain any emotional or subjective language, which makes it difficult to assign a sentiment score. However, since there are no negative or positive connotations in the text, I would rate this conversation as neutral (3). It seems like a technical response rather than a conversation with sentimental undertones."
