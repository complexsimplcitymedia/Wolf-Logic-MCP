    "analysis": "The sentiment of the given context is neutral as it only provides information about the programming tool (Bash) without expressing any positive or negative emotions. Sentiment analysis relies on language patterns that convey emotions, but in this case, there are no such patterns present. Therefore, I would rate it a 3, which represents a neutral sentiment."
