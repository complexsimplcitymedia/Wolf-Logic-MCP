    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this statement appears to be slightly negative, rated as 3. This is because while there's an indication that Prometheus is running successfully (\"Prometheus is UP\"), there's also a problem mentioned with Grafana, which suggests some level of inconvenience or effort will be required to resolve the Docker mount config issue with the compose file. However, it shows proactivity in addressing the issue, which softens the negative tone somewhat."
