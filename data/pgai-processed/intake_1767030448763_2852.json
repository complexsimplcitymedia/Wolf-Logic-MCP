  "sentiment": {
    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation can be rated as 2, leaning slightly towards the negative side. The main reason for this rating is the error message about not being able to load the config file, specifically \"Error loading config\" which suggests a problem with the application's operation. However, it's important to note that the application is still running and listening on a certain port, as indicated by the INFO level messages, suggesting an attempt was made to continue despite the error. The TLS being disabled also hints at potential issues, but without more context, it's hard to determine the severity of that issue. Overall, while there are concerns related to the error and potentially the configuration, the application seems to be running with some limitations (TLS is disabled)."
