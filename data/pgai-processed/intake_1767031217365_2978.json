    "analysis": "Based on the provided context, there is no direct sentiment expressed in this conversation. However, the user's statement about local commands suggests that they are engaging with a system or program rather than another person. Therefore, it doesn't seem to be a conversation between two individuals expressing emotions towards each other. Instead, the user is providing guidance for the AI model not to interact with certain messages. So, in this case, I would rate the sentiment as neutral (3)."
