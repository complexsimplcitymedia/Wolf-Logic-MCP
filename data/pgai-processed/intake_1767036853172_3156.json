    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation appears to be neutral as it's more about stating a fact rather than expressing feelings or opinions. However, if we assume the user is suggesting a change or improvement in current practices (from using IP addresses to using physical addresses), then the implied sentiment could lean slightly positive, indicating a desire for a more user-friendly system.\n\nRating: 3/5 (Neutral leaning slightly positive)"
