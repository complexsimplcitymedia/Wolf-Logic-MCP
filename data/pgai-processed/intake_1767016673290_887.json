Programming languages are tools used for tasks, not emotions or sentiments. Therefore, I would rate it as 0 because it doesn't carry a positive or negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, if we were to extend the conversation, for example, if someone said \"I hate working in Bash\" or \"Bash is amazing\", then those statements would have sentiments and could be rated accordingly."
