    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it seems that the interaction was somewhat negative. The user received an error message (\"Interrupted by user\") from a tool, which can be frustrating for users and may negatively impact their experience. Therefore, I would rate this conversation a 2, as it indicates some level of frustration or dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, since the conversation is limited to just one error message, it's important to note that the overall sentiment might improve once the issue is resolved, or if additional context about the situation becomes available."
