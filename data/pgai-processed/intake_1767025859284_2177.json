    "analysis": "In this instance, there is no sentiment to analyze as the statement is a simple identification of the programming language being used, which is Bash. The statement does not express any emotions or opinions, so it cannot be rated on a sentiment scale from 1-5. However, if we were to assign a neutral rating based on its informative nature, I would rate it as a 3, indicating that it's neither negative nor positive."
