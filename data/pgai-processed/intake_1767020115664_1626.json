    "score": 2,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral, but there's a hint of potential frustration or confusion due to the failure of a script (`fido2-alert.sh`) with an exit code 2 and the requirement for entering a password for `thewolfwalksalone`. However, it doesn't explicitly convey negative emotions, so I would rate it as a 3 on a scale of 1-5, considering that it mainly involves technical issues rather than personal feelings."
