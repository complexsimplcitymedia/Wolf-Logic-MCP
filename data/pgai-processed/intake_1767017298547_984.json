This could lead to difficulties or frustration for the user, especially if they are trying to perform a certain task and encountering this error message.\n\nA rating of 1 on the 5-point sentiment scale might be an overstatement since there is no personal element in this conversation; however, considering the issue faced by the user, it's fair to rate it as a 2 (moderately negative). The assistant could provide additional help or suggestions for troubleshooting or installing the required command."
