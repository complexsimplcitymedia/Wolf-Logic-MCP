  "text": "Here is a summary of the conversation in 2-3 sentences:\n\nA user provided a diagnostic report from a PostgreSQL cluster, showing that the service was running but unable to bind to TCP connections due to peer authentication issues. The root cause of the problem is indicated as PostgreSQL 18-main not listening on port 5433 when running as \"thewolfwalksalone\". To resolve the issue, the user suggested restarting the PostgreSQL service and verifying TCP binding before testing database access.",

Unix socket connections require peer authentication matching the OS user to the database user. Since I\\'m running as \"thewolfwalksalone\", peer auth fails.\\n\\nLet me provide the full diagnostic report.\\n\\n## System Health Report\\n\\n**PostgreSQL**: DEGRADED - Service running but TCP bindings not functional\\n\\n**Root Cause Identified:**\\n\\n1. **PostgreSQL 18-main is running** (PID 87102, systemd service active)\\n2. **Socket is accepting connections** at `/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5433`\\n3. **TCP binding FAILED** - PostgreSQL is configured to listen on `localhost,100.110.82.181` (port 5433) but is NOT actually listening on these TCP interfaces\\n4. **The backup container `wolf-postgres-backup`** on port 5434 does NOT contain the `wolf_logic` database - it\\'s a fresh postgres:18-alpine container\\n\\n**Why TCP is not working:**\\n\\nThe PostgreSQL 18-main configuration at `/etc/postgresql/18/main/postgresql.conf` shows:\\n```\\nlisten_addresses = \\'localhost,100.110.82.181\\'\\nport = 5433\\n```\\n\\nBut `pg_isready` confirms:\\n- Socket `/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5433` - ACCEPTING\\n- localhost:5433 - NO RESPONSE  \\n- 100.110.82.181:5433 - NO RESPONSE\\n\\nThis indicates PostgreSQL likely failed to bind to TCP during startup because either:\\n1. The Tailscale IP 100.110.82.181 was not available when PostgreSQL started\\n2. A configuration reload is needed after changing listen_addresses\\n\\n**Docker**: HEALTHY - 19 containers running, 3 in restart loop (grafana, netdata, prometheus)\\n\\n**Tailscale**: CONNECTED - 100.110.82.181 assigned, daemon active 5h12m\\n\\n**Resources**: \\n- CPU: 1.52 load avg (normal)\\n- Memory: 13Gi/78Gi used (17%)\\n- Disk: 81G/469G on /mnt/Wolf-code (17%)\\n\\n**Conflicts Detected:**\\n1. PostgreSQL TCP binding failure - service up but not listening on network interfaces\\n2. `wolf-postgres-backup` container does NOT have wolf_logic database (empty/fresh DB)\\n\\n**Actions Taken:** Diagnostic only\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n\\n1. **Restart PostgreSQL 18-main to rebind TCP:**\\n```bash\\nsudo systemctl restart postgresql@18-main.service\\n```\\n\\n2. **After restart, verify TCP binding:**\\n```bash\\npg_isready -h localhost -p 5433\\npg_isready -h 100.110.82.181 -p 5433\\n```\\n\\n3. **Then test database access:**\\n```bash\\nPGPASSWORD=wolflogic2024 psql -h 100.110.82.181 -p 5433 -U wolf -d wolf_logic -c \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memories;\"\\n```\\n\\n4. **Optional - Change listen_addresses to \\'*\\' for broader compatibility:**\\nEdit `/etc/postgresql/18/main/postgresql.conf`:\\n```\\nlisten_addresses = \\'*\\'\\n```\\nThen reload: `sudo pg_ctlcluster 18 main reload`\\n\\nDo you want me to restart the PostgreSQL service to restore TCP connectivity?'}, {'type': 'text', 'text': \"agentId: aa034d8 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\"}]}]",
