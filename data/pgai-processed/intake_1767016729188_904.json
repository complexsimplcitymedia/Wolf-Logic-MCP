However, if we consider \"Edit\" as a neutral entity in this context, it would be rated 3 (Neutral) because there is no specific positive or negative connotation associated with it in the given text. If more context were provided about how \"Edit\" was being used, I could potentially analyze its sentiment more accurately within that context."
