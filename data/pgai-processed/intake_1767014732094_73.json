    "analysis": "Based on the limited context provided in your message, it is difficult to accurately determine the sentiment as it seems like a user interruption rather than an expression of sentiment. However, if we assume that the interruption is due to a technical issue or an unforeseen circumstance, the sentiment could be rated around 2-3 (neutral to slightly negative) as it suggests some level of inconvenience or disturbance in the flow of conversation. A more detailed and specific exchange would be required for a more accurate sentiment analysis."
