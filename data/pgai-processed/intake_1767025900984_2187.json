    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is neutral as it does not express any specific emotion or evaluation. The user is suggesting a change in the way addresses are referred to, which could be seen as informative rather than positive or negative. The rating would be around 3.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the statement as a criticism of current practices (referring to IPs instead of addresses), it could lean slightly towards a negative sentiment. But without explicit emotional language or tone, it is hard to assign a definitive rating."
