    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it appears that the user is experiencing an issue with Grafana as they mention it's not responding. This suggests a negative sentiment towards the tool. I would rate this conversation a 2, as there seems to be a problem or frustration with using Grafana at the moment. However, since no explicit negative emotion is expressed, it could still be considered relatively mild in terms of sentiment."
