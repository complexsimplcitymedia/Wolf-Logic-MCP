    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral (3) as it does not provide any emotional context or positive/negative statements. It simply states a fact that there is no native Caddy (a web server software) available. However, the absence of information about the user's intentions or reactions makes it hard to determine a more specific sentiment score."
