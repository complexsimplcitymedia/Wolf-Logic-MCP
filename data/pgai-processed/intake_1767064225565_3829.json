    "analysis": "Sentiment Rating: 3.5 (Neutral to Positive)\n\nExplanation: The conversation seems to be discussing a technical solution, and while it doesn't contain emotional language, the proposed approach suggests a step towards improving security by adding JWT verification, which is generally considered a positive move. However, without more context, it's hard to definitively rate this as very positive since it lacks expressing excitement or enthusiasm."
