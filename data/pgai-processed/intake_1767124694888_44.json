    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "In this specific context, there is no explicit sentiment as the text provided is a command for a Bash tool, which is a type of shell used in operating systems like Linux. The sentence does not convey any emotional or attitudinal tone, so it would be difficult to rate its sentiment on a 1-5 scale. However, if we assume a neutral sentiment, I'd rate it as 3 (neutral), since it's simply stating a technical command and doesn't express any particular positivity or negativity."
