    "analysis": "In this case, the sentiment is neutral as the statement is providing information about a programming tool (Bash) rather than expressing emotion or opinion. However, if we were to rate it based on the tone of the message alone, I'd give it a 4 since it's conveying factual and useful information in a concise manner.\n\nIn a conversation between people, this would not necessarily reflect the overall sentiment due to the nature of providing technical details rather than engaging in emotional or personal exchanges."
