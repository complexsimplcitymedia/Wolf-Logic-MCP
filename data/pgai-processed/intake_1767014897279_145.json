    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation appears to be negative. I would rate it a 1, as the user expresses frustration about an issue they are experiencing with a tool named \"scripty\", which isn't functioning properly and has left them stuck for an extended period. This situation seems to cause inconvenience or even financial loss (implied by being \"stuck under 100k\"), contributing to their negative sentiment. However, it's important to note that the user does not show any aggression or anger in their message, suggesting they are expressing their concerns calmly."
