The first step involved transcribing a script into the \"camera/dailys/\" directory verbatim and categorizing keywords. The second step used keyword categorization, sentiment analysis, and summarization using Llama 3.2, and then ingested the processed data into the PostgreSQL `scripty` namespace.",
