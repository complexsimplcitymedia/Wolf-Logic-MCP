    "analysis": "In this context, there is no apparent sentiment as the statement \"TodoWrite\" is a tool name, not a conversational text that conveys sentiment. However, if we assume it's being used in a positive context (i.e., a productivity or note-taking tool), I would rate its sentiment as 5, indicating it is very positive since it implies efficiency, organization, and productivity."
