However, assuming the user is seeking information or assistance, I would rate this conversation as neutral (3). The user's question indicates they might be in need of help, but there is no indication of negative or positive emotion. If the user receives helpful information about the Tailscale address, the sentiment could shift to positive. On the other hand, if the user does not receive satisfactory assistance, the sentiment might become negative."
