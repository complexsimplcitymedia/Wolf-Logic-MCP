I would rate this exchange as a 2, indicating a slightly negative sentiment. The user appears to be experiencing problems with data not being properly saved or persisted in their PostgreSQL database. This kind of interaction can often create stress and dissatisfaction for the user. However, it's important to note that this rating is based on the content of the user's message alone and does not account for the context of the overall conversation or potential responses from the support team."
