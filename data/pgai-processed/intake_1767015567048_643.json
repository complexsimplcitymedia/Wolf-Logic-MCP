    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is neutral as it only provides information about the tool being used without expressing any particular emotion or opinion. In terms of the rating, I would rate it a 3 because it's informative but lacks emotional context. However, if we were to consider the use of brackets and parentheses as a formality in technical communications, one could argue that it implies a professional and structured tone, which leans slightly positive."
