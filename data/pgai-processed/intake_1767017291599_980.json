    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is negative, rating 2 out of 5. The user received error messages indicating that the script `fido2-alert.sh` failed with exit codes 1 and 2, and they were prompted for a password but required a terminal to provide it or configure an askpass helper. These issues suggest frustration and potential time waste for the user in resolving these technical problems."
