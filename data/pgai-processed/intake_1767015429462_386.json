    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "In the given context, there is no clear sentiment as the statement is a simple declaration of the programming language or shell used - Bash, which is often associated with Unix-like operating systems for scripting and command-line interfaces. Therefore, it's difficult to determine a positive or negative sentiment from this statement alone. However, if we consider the use of Bash as a tool in programming, it can be seen as neutral (rating 3), as it neither implies positivity nor negativity, but rather provides functionality for users depending on their specific needs."
