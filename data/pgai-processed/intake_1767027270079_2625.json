  "text": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of our conversation:\n\nThis conversation started with the assistant providing examples of how to use PostgREST in Bash, including querying various endpoints such as listing tables and searching by content. The assistant then demonstrated how to test these examples from their terminal using curl commands. The assistant also explained that PostgREST has now been successfully implemented into a REST API with Librarian, a library for building and testing PostgreSQL REST APIs.",
