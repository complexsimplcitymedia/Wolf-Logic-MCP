  "text": "You've enabled a sandbox environment within your local command-line interface (CLI) and given it the ability to execute bash commands without needing explicit permission or input. This suggests that you may be using a Linux-based system, such as Ubuntu, with a tool like Bash that allows for sandboxed execution of commands. The \"auto-allow\" feature likely means that new users will also have access to this sandbox environment by default.",
