    "analysis": "In this specific context, where there is only a reference to a tool named \"TodoWrite\", it's difficult to determine the sentiment as there are no explicit emotional or evaluative language used. However, if we assume that \"TodoWrite\" is some kind of productivity or task management software, a neutral tone can be inferred since the statement doesn't convey any positive or negative emotions towards the tool.\n\nRating: 3 (Neutral)"
