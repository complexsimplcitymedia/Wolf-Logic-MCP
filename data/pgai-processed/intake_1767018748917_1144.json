The assistant is offering a solution to a problem, which indicates a helpful and proactive approach, thus the positive tone. However, it does not express enthusiasm or excitement, hence the neutral rating. The assistant's response focuses on task resolution rather than emotional engagement, which is typical of a technical support role."
