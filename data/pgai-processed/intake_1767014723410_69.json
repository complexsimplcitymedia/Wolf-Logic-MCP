    "analysis": "The sentiment of the provided text is neutral as it does not contain any emotional or subjective language, but rather just a statement of the name of a tool. Therefore, I would rate it a 3 on the scale you provided, indicating a neutral sentiment.\n\nHowever, if we consider the context that this tool's name (TodoWrite) is typically associated with productivity and task management, one could argue that there might be a positive undertone implying efficiency and organization. But since the text itself does not express any emotion or opinion, it remains neutral in sentiment."
