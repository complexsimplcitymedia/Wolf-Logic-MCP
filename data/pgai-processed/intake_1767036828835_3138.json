    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of the conversation appears to be neutral, as it provides information about multiple PostgreSQL clusters and their statuses. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if the user finds this information useful or not, which could potentially influence the sentiment slightly towards positive (3) if they are looking for such details, or negative (2) if they were expecting something different."
