  "text": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of our conversation:\n\nYou are using the `Claude.md` file and encountered an issue with the script, specifically that it was not utilizing the `llama3.2:1b` summarizer. You want to either modify the script to use Ollama for summarization or leave it as-is for now and use verbatim capture only. The script's current state is incomplete, requiring further modification to integrate with llama3.2:1b.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: Yes. CLAUDE.md line 389 says: **\"Scripty runs every 30 seconds (llama3.2:1b summarizer)\"**\n\nThe script I just wrote is basic verbatim capture - it's NOT using llama3.2:1b. It's incomplete.\n\nDo you want me to:\n1. Fix it to call llama3.2:1b via Ollama for summarization?\n2. Or keep it as-is for now (verbatim only)?",
