The assistant is simply stating what actions they will take, which does not inherently indicate positivity or negativity. However, it's important to note that a positive sentiment can be implied by the fact that the assistant is actively working on resolving the network issue, suggesting a proactive approach and commitment to helping.\n\nRating: 3 (Neutral)"
