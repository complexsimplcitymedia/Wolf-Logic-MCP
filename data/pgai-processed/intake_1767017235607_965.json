    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "In this specific context, there's no sentiment to analyze as the statement is a simple declaration about the tool being used, which in this case is Bash. The sentiment can be considered neutral (3) because it doesn't convey any positive or negative emotions or attitudes. However, Bash is often associated with programming and system administration, so it may imply a positive sentiment related to technology and problem-solving tasks if the context is appropriate."
