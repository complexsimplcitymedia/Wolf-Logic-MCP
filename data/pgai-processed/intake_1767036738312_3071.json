I rate it as 2, leaning towards a slightly lower rating due to the user's apparent annoyance with the repeated occurrence of the problem.\n\nThe user is questioning the statement that was made, suggesting they are unsure or dissatisfied with the current situation. A more positive sentiment would involve the user expressing gratitude for assistance in resolving the issue or demonstrating a constructive approach towards finding a solution.
