    "analysis": "Based on the provided user message \"[Request interrupted by user]\", it appears that the sentiment is neutral to slightly negative. The interruption of a request can be seen as disruptive, which might lead to frustration or annoyance, but without additional context, it's hard to determine the exact level of negativity. However, since the message does not contain explicit signs of anger or dissatisfaction, I would rate this conversation as neutral."
