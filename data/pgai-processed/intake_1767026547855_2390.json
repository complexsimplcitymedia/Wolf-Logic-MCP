In this case, the sentiment is neutral as it does not express any emotional content or positive or negative emotion. It simply states a command or instruction.\n\nHowever, in a broader context within a dialogue, this command could be perceived differently depending on the situation and the recipient's attitude towards the task at hand. For example:\n- If the recipient is eager to write, they might view \"Write\" as encouraging or positive.\n- If the recipient finds writing challenging or dislikes it, they might perceive \"Write\" as negative or demanding.\n\nIn this analysis, I rated the statement as 3 because it's neutral without specific emotional content."
