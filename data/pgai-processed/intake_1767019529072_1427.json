  "sentiment": {
    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is very negative. The user is encountering an error message when trying to access a remote server with the error \"Permission denied\". This indicates that the user does not have the necessary permissions to perform the action, which can be frustrating and time-consuming to resolve. Additionally, the repeated messages asking the user to try again suggest that the issue may persist until the correct login credentials or permissions are provided. The error message itself provides some guidance on how to proceed by suggesting that the user might need to use a password in addition to a public key for authentication. Overall, the sentiment is negative due to the frustration and potential roadblocks that come with encountering an error while attempting to access a remote server."
