The error message explains that this is due to a requirement for a terminal to read the password, and suggests using the `-S` option instead.",

    "score": 2,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of the conversation is neutral to slightly negative. The user received an error message with exit code 1, indicating a failure in executing the script `fido2-alert.sh`. Additionally, the user encountered two issues while using sudo: a terminal is required to read the password and there was no askpass helper configured, as well as needing a password. While these issues do not necessarily convey positive emotions, they are common troubleshooting scenarios in programming and development tasks. A rating of 2 seems appropriate for this conversation."
