    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral to slightly positive. The user seems to be expressing optimism about a future action (installing PostgREST). However, the lack of explicit emotional language or positive expressions keeps the overall sentiment neutral. A rating of 3 would be appropriate for this conversation."
