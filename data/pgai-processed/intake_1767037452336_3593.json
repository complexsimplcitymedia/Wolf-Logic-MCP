    "analysis": "In this particular instance, I cannot analyze the sentiment as there is only a single line provided which states the task (\"Tool: Task\"). Sentiment analysis requires contextual understanding of conversations between two or more parties. Therefore, I would rate it as neutral (3) as it doesn't convey any specific emotion or sentiment. The sentence seems to be informative and descriptive rather than emotional or expressive."
