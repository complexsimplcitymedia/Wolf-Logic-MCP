    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "In this case, there's no clear sentiment as the text provided is a command written in Bash, which is a shell scripting language. It doesn't contain any emotional or subjective information that can be used to infer sentiment. However, if we consider the context of using a tool like Bash for programming tasks, it could indicate a positive sentiment towards productivity and problem-solving since Bash is commonly used for these purposes. But the rating would still be neutral (3) as there's no emotional or subjective content."
