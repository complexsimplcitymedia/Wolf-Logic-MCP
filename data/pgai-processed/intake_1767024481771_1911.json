    "analysis": "In this specific case, there is no sentiment involved as the statement is a technical one about a programming tool (Bash) rather than a conversation between individuals expressing emotions or opinions. Therefore, it's not possible to rate it on a sentiment scale from 1-5. However, the tone remains informative and neutral, suitable for describing technical information."
