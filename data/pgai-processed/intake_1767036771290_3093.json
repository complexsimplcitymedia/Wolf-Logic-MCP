    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral to slightly negative. The user is facing an issue with connecting to a PostgreSQL server, which can be frustrating. However, the user's message does not express anger or frustration directly, but rather poses a question about the potential cause of the problem. The error message provided by the tool also remains objective and informative, rather than accusatory or judgmental. Therefore, I would rate this conversation as 3 out of 5, leaning slightly towards neutral due to the presence of an issue but the lack of strong negative emotion."
