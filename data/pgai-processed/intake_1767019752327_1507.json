    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "In this conversation, there is no direct expression of sentiment, as it only involves a statement about a tool named \"TodoWrite\". However, if we consider the implication, it seems neutral since it's simply providing information about a tool without expressing any personal feelings or opinions.\n\nI would rate it a 3, leaning slightly towards neutral because there is no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed in the statement. The use of a tool name suggests an objective and informative context rather than an emotional one."
