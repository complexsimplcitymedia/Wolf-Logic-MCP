  "text": "Here is a summary of our conversation in 2-3 sentences:\n\nWe discussed the pipeline setup for two data processing tools, Scripty and Swarm. Scripty captures the output of another tool (Llama 3.2) verbatim and stores it in specific folders, while Swarm processes and stores transcripts from the same Llama version ingested into PostgreSQL. The goal is to capture everything and process it accordingly.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: Copy that. Pipeline is:\n\n1. **Scripty** \u2192 Verbatim transcription to `camera/dailys/`\n2. **Swarm** \u2192 Reads transcripts, summarizes (llama3.2:1b), ingests to PostgreSQL\n\nScripty's job = capture everything. Swarm's job = process and store.\n\nGot it.",
