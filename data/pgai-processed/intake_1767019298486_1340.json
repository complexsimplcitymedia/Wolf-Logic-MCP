    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of the conversation is neutral, rated 3. The user received a message from Git about untracked files in their current branch, which is common during software development and doesn't necessarily indicate an error or problem but rather the need for further action (e.g., adding these files to the git repository). Therefore, the tone of the conversation remains neutral and informative."
