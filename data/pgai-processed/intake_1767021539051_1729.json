    "score": 2,
    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral, but the content indicates a problem or error. The user's message is about an issue with a Python script (scripty_agent.py) due to the absence of the 'requests' module. The error message suggests that the 'requests' module needs to be installed using pip, and there is also an embedded error related to an API call. Overall, it seems like a technical problem that requires troubleshooting to resolve the issue.\n\nRating: 2 (Neutral but with a problematic situation)"
