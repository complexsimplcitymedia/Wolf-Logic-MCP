    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it appears to be a technical interaction between a user and a tool or system, as the response indicates found files related to a project (wolf-logic-mcp-mem). Since there is no explicit sentiment in the conversation, I would rate this interaction as a 3. It's neutral because it does not convey any positive or negative emotions but instead focuses on providing information about the found files. However, if we consider the context, finding these files might be helpful to the user and could be interpreted as slightly positive."
