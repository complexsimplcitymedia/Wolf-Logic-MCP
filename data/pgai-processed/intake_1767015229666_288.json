    "analysis": "Based on the provided message, it is difficult to determine the exact sentiment as the statement \"[Request interrupted by user]\" does not contain specific words or phrases that directly express a positive or negative emotion. However, since the user has presumably interrupted a request, which could imply some level of control or dissatisfaction, I would rate this interaction as a 2. The user's action might suggest a slightly negative sentiment, but it is important to note that the context and further interactions may alter this assessment."
