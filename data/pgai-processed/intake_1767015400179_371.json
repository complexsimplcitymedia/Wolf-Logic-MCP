The specific error message indicates that it was not able to find a valid Git repository anywhere. This issue suggests that the system may be set up for or attempt to use a different type of file system than what Git is configured to expect.",

The user encountered an error message (exit code 128) while trying to interact with a Git repository, indicating that either there is no Git repository at the specified location or there is an issue with the Git installation. This can cause frustration and delays in work. A possible solution could be setting GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM or ensuring that the user is working within a valid Git repository."
