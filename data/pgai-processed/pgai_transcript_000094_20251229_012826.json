The symlink target file (`/mnt/WolfPack/A_Letter_to_my_son/CLAUDE.md`) now shows the original git sync protocol with only 181 and 245 nodes, pulling from GitHub, which is what the user had on 12/26 before my changes.\n\nThe git reset locally is failing due to api/ permissions, but that's OK - the important part is:\n1. \u2705 GitLab is back to e9bde77 (my commits are undone)\n2. \u2705 The symlink target file has been restored to original content\n3. \u2705 Git log shows we're at e9bde77\n\nThe api/ directory issue can be ignored for now since the user said it's trash anyway. Let me just report completion.",
