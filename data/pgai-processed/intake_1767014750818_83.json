    "analysis": "The sentiment in this conversation is neutral as it does not provide much context about the situation or feelings involved. However, the term \"sandboxed\" can be interpreted as a reference to restricted or limited access, which could imply some level of frustration or constraint if used negatively. But without more information, it's hard to determine the exact sentiment accurately.\n\nRating: 2 (Neutral)"
