    "score": 2,
    "analysis": "Based on the conversation, the sentiment appears to be negative as the user is encountering an error due to a missing dependency ('requests') in their script. The error message is informative and instructs the user to install the necessary module using pip, but the additional error regarding the scripty embedder not found suggests there might be more complex issues at hand.\n\nRating: 2 (Negative)\n\nThe conversation doesn't contain any overtly positive elements, as it discusses an issue that needs to be addressed by the user. However, it does provide a solution for resolving the problem."
