    "score": 3,
    "analysis": "Based on the provided conversation, it appears to be a network status report rather than a conversation between individuals. As such, the sentiment is neutral (3) as it simply provides information without expressing any positive or negative emotions. However, if we interpret the status of some devices being offline for extended periods (12 days, 14 hours, 22 days) as an indication of potential issues, the sentiment could lean slightly negative (2). Nevertheless, without additional context, it is challenging to definitively assign a sentiment score."
