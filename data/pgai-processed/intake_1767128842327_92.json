    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral to slightly negative. The user encountered an error (\"Interrupted by user\") while using a tool, which can be frustrating and therefore contributes to the negative aspect. However, since the error message doesn't provide further details about the issue, it lacks sufficient information to determine a more specific sentiment. Thus, I would rate this conversation a 2 on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being very negative)."
