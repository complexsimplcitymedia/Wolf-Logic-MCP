    "analysis": "In this given conversation, there is no direct indication of sentiment as it only states the tool being used (\"Read\"). Therefore, it's not possible to rate the sentiment based on the provided information. However, in a broader context, if \"Read\" refers to a useful or helpful tool, it can be assumed to have a positive sentiment (4). If it refers to a difficult or complicated tool, it may have a negative sentiment (1-2), but without more context, it is uncertain."
