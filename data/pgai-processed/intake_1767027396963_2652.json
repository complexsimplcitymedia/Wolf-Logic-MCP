    "analysis": "The sentiment of this conversation is neutral (3). The user is stating that there is no native Caddy, which might indicate a lack or absence of something, but without additional context it's hard to determine if the user is frustrated, indifferent, or simply informing someone else. Caddy is a web server designed for HTTP/2 and TLS by default, so in a technical support context, this statement could be seen as relevant and neutral."
