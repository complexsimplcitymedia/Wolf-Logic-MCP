    "analysis": "Based on the provided text, it is difficult to determine the exact sentiment as there is no explicit expression of feelings or opinions. However, since the user has interrupted a request, it could suggest some level of dissatisfaction or impatience, hence a rating of 2 (Neutral-Slightly Negative). This is just an interpretation and actual sentiment might vary depending on the context of the conversation before this point."
