    "analysis": "The sentiment in this statement is neutral as it does not provide any context or emotion to determine positivity or negativity. However, if we assume the user is asking about a task or instruction, the intention seems to be neutral to slightly positive as they are asking for action to be taken.\n\nA rating of 3 might be appropriate since it suggests a request or instruction rather than expressing enthusiasm or disapproval."
