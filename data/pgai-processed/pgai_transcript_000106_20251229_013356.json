Let me update the architecture to reflect 4 nodes total: 181, 245 (x2), and 250. I need to ask what the two 245 nodes are (maybe 245a and 245b, or different IPs).\n\nActually, wait - let me check the git sync protocol regex. It has '100\\.110\\.82\\.(181|245|250)' - so it's matching node IPs. If there are two 245s, they might have different IPs like 100.110.82.245 and maybe something else? Or maybe the user means there are literally two physical machines at the same IP? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me just update the architecture to note there are two 245 nodes and ask if they have different IPs or if I should handle them differently.",
