    "analysis": "The sentiment in this statement is neutral, rated at about 3. The user is simply stating their intention to follow a set of procedures, which doesn't necessarily imply any particular emotion or attitude. However, if we consider the context of starting a business, the process could potentially be seen as a positive step towards achieving a goal, thus slightly leaning towards a positive sentiment."
