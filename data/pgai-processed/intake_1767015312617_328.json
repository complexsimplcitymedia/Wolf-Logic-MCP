  "text": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of our conversation:\n\nI will review the script you wrote before assisting with it, as \"Scripty\" appears to refer to a transcription tool rather than an editor or summarizer. The script will now capture full verbatim transcripts and write them to a JSONL file named `scripty_20251229.jsonl`. This is expected to meet your requirements.",
  "content": "ASSISTANT: Copy that. Scripty = **transcriber** (verbatim), not summarizer.\n\nThe script I wrote is correct then - it captures full verbatim transcripts to `camera/dailys/`. The llama3.2:1b reference in CLAUDE.md must be for a different component.\n\nScripty is running now and writing to:\n`camera/dailys/scripty_20251229.jsonl`\n\nShould be good.",
