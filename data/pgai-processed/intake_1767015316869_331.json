  "text": "Here is a summary of our conversation in 2-3 sentences:\n\nThe conversation revolves around the operation of two AI tools, Scripty and Swarm, which are used for transcription and data processing tasks. Scripty captures every word, while Swarm processes and stores the transcripts. The tools have specific roles: Scripty's job is to capture everything (verbatim transcription), and Swarm's job is to process and store the information (ingesting the transcript into PostgreSQL).",
