GitLab remote configuration documentation\n2. Working directory path changes\n\nBut they told me earlier that \"those are ur changes not mines\" and \"my last changes were probably 12/26\". So I restored the original version from 12/26.\n\nNow they're asking me to put those changes back. This means they DO want those changes after all.\n\nLet me add back:\n1. GitLab remote configuration (URL, SSH key, 3-node architecture)\n2. Working directory path specification\n\nI need to edit the symlink target at `/mnt/WolfPack/A_Letter_to_my_son/CLAUDE.md`.",
