The git status shows:\n- No modified files in tracked directories (including writers/)\n- Only untracked files: .github/instructions/, CLAUDE.md~HEAD, and wolf-logic-mcp-mem/\n\nThis confirms that the copy operation did NOT overwrite any files in writers/. The newest version persisted correctly.What likely happened:- The parent directory's writers/ directory didn't exist or was already removed before my cp command\n- Or the cp command failed silently due to 2>/dev/null\n- Either way, the writers/ directory in Wolf-Logic-MCP remained untouched\n\nSo to answer Wolf's question: Yes, the newest persisted correctly. The merge commit 663b91c used \"newest wins\" logic, and no subsequent operations modified the tracked files.",
