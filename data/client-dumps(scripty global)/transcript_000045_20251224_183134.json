  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nThe user is clarifying that scripty can't be in docker-compose because Ollama runs on the host, not in Docker. This makes sense - Ollama is installed natively on the server and scripty needs to access it via the host's Ollama service.\n\nSo the original task remains: create a server-scripty configuration that uses llama3.2:1b or another small chat model to transcribe locally. Since it can't be containerized (needs host Ollama access), it should be:\n\n1. A systemd service (like the other server services)\n2. Or a standalone script that runs on the host\n3. Needs to be organized into the server-configuration subfolder\n\nLet me refocus on the original task.",
