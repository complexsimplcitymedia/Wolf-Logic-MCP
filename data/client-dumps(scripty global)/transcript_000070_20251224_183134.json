  "user": "So he should get swarmed, that's the fucking pipeline: he drops it to a fucking client dump or something like that.And then they swarm it, the swarm is supposed to be keywording, categorizing, and Mistral is supposed to be doing fucking sentiment, and that's supposed to be handed over to PGAI.",
  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nOkay, so the user is correcting my understanding of the pipeline. Let me break down what they're saying:\n\n**Server-scripty (llama3.2:1b) role:**\n1. Watch Claude session files\n2. Summarize exchanges\n3. Drop summaries to a \"client dump\" directory\n\n**Then the swarm takes over:**\n1. Multiple models work on the summaries:\n   - Some do keywording\n   - Some do categorizing\n   - Mistral does sentiment analysis\n\n**Finally:**\n- All that processed data gets handed to pgai\n- pgai does the embedding and DB write\n\nSo the pipeline is:\n1. server-scripty (llama3.2:1b) \u2192 summarize \u2192 drop to dump directory\n2. Swarm workers (multiple models) \u2192 keyword/categorize/sentiment \u2192 process the dumps\n3. pgai \u2192 embed + write to DB\n\nThis is a multi-stage pipeline with division of labor. I need to:\n1. Update server-scripty to just dump summaries (already does this mostly)\n2. Need to create the swarm processing layer\n3. pgai picks up the processed output\n\nLet me confirm this understanding and ask what needs to be built.",
