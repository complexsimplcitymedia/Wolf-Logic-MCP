  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nLooking at the git log, the most recent commit is \"feat: Add MCP Intake Stream API for text ingestion and processing\" (e9bde77). This is likely in Wolf-Logic-MCP since that's where the git repository is tracked.\n\nThe user is asking if the newest files persisted. During the move operation, when I copied writers/* to Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/, there could have been overwrites. Let me check if the Wolf-Logic-MCP directory already had a .git directory and if the files there are the newest.\n\nActually, looking back at the directory structure:\n- `/mnt/Wolf-code/Wolf-Ai-Enterptises/.git` exists (repository root)\n- `/mnt/Wolf-code/Wolf-Ai-Enterptises/Wolf-Logic-MCP/.git` also exists\n\nSo there were TWO git repositories. The parent directory had a .git and Wolf-Logic-MCP also had a .git.\n\nThe recent commit (e9bde77) about \"MCP Intake Stream API\" suggests Wolf-Logic-MCP was the active development directory. The parent directory likely had older duplicate files.\n\nLet me verify which files are newer by checking modification times in the writers directory.",
