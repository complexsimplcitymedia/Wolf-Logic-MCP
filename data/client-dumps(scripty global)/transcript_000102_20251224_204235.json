Change complexsimplicityai.com to use port 4500 (wolf-ui)\n2. Fix wolf-logic-api from 8000 to 8002\n3. Add cadvisor.complexsimplicityai.com pointing to 8081\n4. Figure out what caddy-manager should point to (currently has wrong port 80)\n\nLet me ask about caddy-manager or just update the ones I know are correct.",
