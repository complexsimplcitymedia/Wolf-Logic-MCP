  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nThe preserved-old writers directory has files from Dec 24 17:36, which was when the merge conflict was resolved.Now let me check when the files in the current Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers were last modified. I already saw they have timestamps of 17:50 (when I just copied) and 17:27 (from before).Wait, I need to reconsider what happened. Let me trace through the timeline:\n\n1. 17:33 - Merge conflict resolution created preserved-old, \"newest wins\" put newer files in Wolf-Logic-MCP\n2. 17:27 - Some writers files in Wolf-Logic-MCP (these would be the \"newest\" from the merge)\n3. 17:50 - I just copied writers/* from parent directory, overwriting files in Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/\n\nThis means I MAY have overwritten the newer files (from 17:27) with older files from the parent directory.But wait - if the parent directory's writers was already removed during the cleanup, where did I copy from? Let me re-read my command:\n\n```\ncp -r writers/* Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/ 2>/dev/null; rm -rf writers\n```\n\nThis was run from /mnt/Wolf-code/Wolf-Ai-Enterptises/, and it tried to copy from a writers directory there to Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/. But if the parent had a writers directory, and the merge resolution put the newest in Wolf-Logic-MCP, then the parent's writers would have been the OLD version.So I likely DID overwrite newer files with older ones. This is bad.\n\nLet me check if I can restore from preserved-old.",
