Let me check if they meant ALL items or just the visible ones.Actually, the count of 7 from earlier was the visible count. Now that those are moved, should I move the hidden files too?Let me query the Librarian to understand if there's guidance on this, or just ask the user.Actually, let me think about this practically:- .git and .gitignore should stay at parent level since /mnt/Wolf-code/Wolf-Ai-Enterptises is the git repository root- .env files are environment configs - if they're duplicates of what's in Wolf-Logic-MCP, move them. If they're parent-level configs for the whole Wolf-Ai-Enterprises, keep them.Let me check if these .env files exist in Wolf-Logic-MCP.",
