We were discussing creating a server-scripty config using llama or small chat model to transcribe locally\n2. I tried to write a server-scripty.py file but the user rejected it\n3. Then user asked about docker-compose.181.yml which I just explained\n4. Now they say \"to it transcribes\"\n\nThis seems like the user might be saying:\n- \"Add to it transcribes\" - add transcription to docker-compose.181.yml?\n- \"So it transcribes\" - making a statement about scripty transcribing?\n- Typo/incomplete thought?\n\nGiven the context, I think they want me to add the scripty transcription service to the docker-compose.181.yml file. That makes sense - we need to containerize the server-scripty service and add it to the 181 infrastructure stack.\n\nLet me ask for clarification or propose adding scripty as a service to docker-compose.181.yml.",
