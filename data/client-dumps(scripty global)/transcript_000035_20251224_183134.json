Commit 663b91c resolved merge conflicts with \"newest wins\" - preserving older copies in preserved-old/3. The current HEAD is at 663b91c, which means the newest version won\n\nWhen I moved files from the parent directory to Wolf-Logic-MCP just now:\n- The parent directory likely had the OLD versions (from the origin/master branch - commits 6df3c7d and e6a8f70)\n- Wolf-Logic-MCP had the NEW versions (from the main branch - including e9bde77)\n- When I tried to copy writers/*, if it actually copied, it would have overwritten new with old\n\nBut git diff showed no changes, which means either:\n1. The copy failed silently (because writers didn't exist in parent), OR\n2. The files were identicalLet me verify what actually happened by checking if there's any uncommitted changes.",
