  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nThe user wants me to:\n1. Convert docker-compose.181.yml to Docker Swarm stack format\n2. Ensure Grafana, Prometheus, and Authentik are working\n3. Configure Authentik to communicate with Caddy manager on 100.110.82.181:2019\n\nDocker Swarm uses stack deploy instead of docker-compose. The format is similar but there are key differences:\n- Uses `deploy:` section instead of `restart:`\n- Placement constraints for nodes\n- Replicas instead of single containers\n- Secrets and configs management\n- Networks need to be overlay networks for swarm\n\nLet me first check what's in the current docker-compose.181.yml and then convert it to a swarm-compatible stack file.",
