The copy operation didn't actually overwrite anything (maybe the source didn't exist), OR2. The files were identical\n\nLet me verify if the parent directory even HAD a writers directory when I tried to copy. Looking back at my commands, I ran:`cp -r writers/* Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/ 2>/dev/null; rm -rf writers`And the output was empty. The `2>/dev/null` suppressed errors, so if writers/* didn't exist in the parent, the cp would have failed silently.Let me check the actual state - did the newest persist?",
