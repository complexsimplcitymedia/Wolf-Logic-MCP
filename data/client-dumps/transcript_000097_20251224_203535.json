They said \"complexsimplicityai.com on 7001\" but I think they meant that's for the main site, not caddy-manager. Let me look at what port caddy-manager actually needs.\n\nLooking back at the original config they showed me:\n```\n# Caddy Manager\ncaddy-manager.complexsimplicityai.com {\n        import custom_wildcard_tls\n        import security_headers\n        reverse_proxy http://100.110.82.181:80\n}\n```\n\nThey said port 80 is wrong. The admin API is on 2019 but that's not the manager UI. Let me think... caddy-manager might be a separate service. Let me ask what port it should be.",
