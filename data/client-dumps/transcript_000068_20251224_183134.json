  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nOh shit, I misunderstood. The user is saying that server-scripty should NOT be writing embeds to the database. Let me look at what I created in server-scripty.py - I had it writing summaries to a STAGING directory for pgai vectorizer to pick up, which is correct (no direct DB writes). But the user is saying it shouldn't be doing that either.\n\nLet me think about what server-scripty should actually do:\n1. It's supposed to transcribe sessions locally using llama3.2:1b\n2. But it's NOT supposed to write embeddings to DB\n3. The user is emphasizing \"only pgai writes to DB\"\n\nSo what SHOULD it do? I think it should just:\n- Watch the session\n- Summarize with llama3.2:1b\n- Write the summaries to a file somewhere that pgai can ingest\n- That's it - no embedding, no DB writes\n\nActually wait, I already did that - I wrote summaries to a staging directory. But maybe that's still not right? Let me re-read what I wrote...\n\nLooking at server-scripty.py:\n- It writes to STAGING_DIR = Path(\"/mnt/Wolf-code/Wolf-Ai-Enterptises/Wolf-Logic-MCP/data/scripty-staging\")\n- Files are .txt format\n- No DB connection at all\n- No embedding\n\nThat seems correct to me. But the user is saying \"shit's not supposed to be writing embeds to the fucking DB\" - so maybe the user thinks I'm doing something I'm not? Or maybe I need to clarify the design?\n\nActually, I think the issue might be that the user wants me to understand the BIGGER picture - what is server-scripty for? It's for creating summaries that can be fed into the ingestion pipeline. But it should NOT be part of the embedding/vectorization process.\n\nLet me stop the service and explain what I understand.",
