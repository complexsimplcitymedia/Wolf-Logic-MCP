During the earlier merge conflict resolution (commit 663b91c), there were two versions of writers\n2. The \"newest wins\" logic put the newer version in Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/\n3. The older version was preserved in preserved-old/20251224T223300Z/writers/\n\nNow, when I just ran `cp -r writers/* Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/` from the parent directory, I need to determine:\n- Was the parent directory's writers/ the old version or the new version?\n- Did I just overwrite the new with the old?\n\nLet me check the timestamps in the preserved-old writers to compare.",
