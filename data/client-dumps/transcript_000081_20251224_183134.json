Or write an MD file for Gemini to pick up\n\nGiven the context that we just created GEMINI.md and we have android-client/ directory with Wolf-Logic-app, I think they want me to create a markdown file in the android-client directory that Gemini can reference (similar to how CLAUDE.md works for Claude).\n\nLet me create GEMINI.md in android-client/ directory with instructions specific to Android development and the Wolf Logic app.",
