  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nThose are the 7 visible items. But there are also hidden files (.env, .envrc, .git, .gitignore, etc). Let me check if they should be moved too. The user said \"final 7 items\" which likely refers to the visible count. Let me move all items that aren't Wolf-Logic-MCP itself.\n\nActually, I need to be careful here:\n- .git should NOT be moved - that's the parent git repo\n- .gitignore might be parent-level\n- .env files - these might be parent-level configs\n\nLet me just move what's visible and safe to move. But wait, \"traefik\" directory still exists? I thought we deleted it. Let me check if it's a different one.",
