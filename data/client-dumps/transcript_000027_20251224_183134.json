  "assistant": "[THINKING]\nI see timestamps from Dec 24 17:50 (today, just now) and Dec 24 17:27 (earlier today). The 17:50 timestamps are from when I just did the copy operation. This is bad - I may have overwritten newer files with older ones.\n\nBut wait - let me think about this more carefully. The parent directory `/mnt/Wolf-code/Wolf-Ai-Enterptises/` had duplicate files. When I did `cp -r writers/* Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/`, I would have copied FROM the parent's writers directory TO Wolf-Logic-MCP/writers/.\n\nBut actually, I removed the parent's writers directory with `rm -rf writers` after the copy. So the question is: were the parent's writers files newer or older than Wolf-Logic-MCP's writers files?\n\nGiven the git log shows recent commits in Wolf-Logic-MCP (e9bde77 \"feat: Add MCP Intake Stream API\"), and the parent directory was supposed to be duplicates, the Wolf-Logic-MCP versions should have been newer.\n\nBut I may have overwritten them with the cp -r command. Let me check if there's a way to verify.\n\nActually, looking at the merge conflict resolution from the git status at the beginning:\n\"663b91c Resolve merge conflicts \u2014 newest wins. Preserved older copies under preserved-old/20251224T223300Z/\"\n\nThis suggests there was already a merge conflict resolution where newest was chosen. The parent directory may have had older versions that were duplicates.\n\nLet me check if preserved-old exists and what's in it.",
