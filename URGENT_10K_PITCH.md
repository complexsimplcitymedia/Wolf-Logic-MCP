## The Pitch (30 seconds)

AI-powered job search mobile app launching **this Friday** with persistent memory across sessions.

We've built what ChatGPT doesn't have: **true memory**. 88,000+ vectorized memories, production infrastructure deployed, app ready to ship.

**Need $10K to survive launch week.** Facing homelessness, will keep servers running and execute launch.

5% equity. SAFE note. 48-hour close.

## What You're Buying Into

**Working Technology:**
- 88K+ memories, 2560-dimensional embeddings (qwen3-embedding:4b)
- Production stack: Qdrant, Neo4j, PostgreSQL with pgai, Ollama
- Mobile app (React Native) - approved, launch-ready
- Tailscale network, Traefik reverse proxy, full DevOps

**Differentiation:**
- First AI job search app with true persistent memory
- Learns from every interaction, builds knowledge graph
- Targets underrepresented talent (POC, veterans, career switchers)

**Founder:**
- 10,000+ hours invested
- Sacrificed family time to build this
- Infrastructure architect, full-stack engineer
- Combat experience (leadership under pressure)

**Timeline:**
- Friday: Play Store launch
- Week 1: User acquisition, feedback loop
- Week 2-4: Iterate, grow
- 60-90 days: Seed round ($250K-$500K at higher valuation)

## The Deal

**Investment:** $10,000
**Equity:** 5%
**Instrument:** YC SAFE note (post-money, $200K valuation cap)
**Close:** 48 hours from handshake

**Use of Funds:**
- Rent/housing: $8,000 (survival through launch + 30 days)
- Server costs: $1,000
- Launch marketing: $1,000

## Why This Works

You're not betting on an idea. You're betting on:
1. **Working product** (ships Friday)
2. **Proven builder** (deployed production infrastructure)
3. **Market timing** (AI + job search = hot)
4. **Founder survival** (keeps infrastructure online, executes launch)

$10K now = 5% of a company that could exit for millions.
$10K later = missed opportunity.

**Worst case:** Tax write-off
**Best case:** 100x+ return when we raise at $10M+ valuation
