# LinkedIn Outreach Strategy - Cargill AI Team

## Primary Target: Spencer Schaber
**Title:** Manufacturing AI & Process Modeling Leader, Americas at Cargill
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencerschaber/

### Connection Request Message (300 char limit):
```
Spencer - I architect AI at production scale. 46.5k vectorized memories, semantic search, swarm patterns. Job 308723 (June posting) - real or ghost? Live proof: portfolio.complexsimplicityai.com
```

### Follow-up Message (After Connection):
```
Spencer,

I'm reaching out about Cargill's Senior AI Platform Engineer role (Job ID 308723) in Atlanta.

Context: I don't apply through ATS. I architect systems that demonstrate capability before conversation.

**Live Production Systems:**
- pgai contextual memory: 46,544 vectorized memories (pgvector, 768 dimensions, nomic-embed-text:v1.5)
- Automated job aggregation: 1,836 positions (Indeed/LinkedIn scraping)
- Full infrastructure: Docker orchestration, Caddy reverse proxy (22 routes), FIDO2 auth
- GPU acceleration: AMD ROCm, Ollama embedding fleet
- Proof of work: https://portfolio.complexsimplicityai.com

**The Question:**
This position was posted in June. It's December. Has it been filled, or is your team still actively hiring?

I don't waste time on ghost postings. If this is real, I need 15 minutes with whoever's making the hiring decision.

**Why I'm different:**
I think in swarms, not silos. I architect for scale, not POCs. I build systems that remember across sessions - permanent context, not ephemeral conversations.

Your Atlanta hub is hiring 400 people in AI/Data. I'm the kind of engineer who builds the infrastructure those 400 people will use.

Direct question: Who's the decision maker for Job 308723?

Portfolio: https://portfolio.complexsimplicityai.com
Resume: https://portfolio.complexsimplicityai.com/resume.html
Job Board (proof of aggregation capability): https://portfolio.complexsimplicityai.com/jobs.html

Ready to demonstrate capability live.
```

3. **Ana Chatbot** - Wolf handles directly (testing if position is real)
4. **Text to 60196** - "CargillJobs" SMS line (backup channel)

## Key Talking Points

1. **Ghost Posting Challenge:** "Job posted June, still open December - real or ghost?"
2. **No ATS:** "I speak with decision makers directly. ATS wastes everyone's time."
3. **Live Proof:** "Systems running now. Not theoretical. Portfolio at complexsimplicityai.com"
4. **Scale Thinking:** "46,544 memories. Swarm intelligence. Infrastructure for 400-person teams."
5. **Differentiation:** "Permanent context across sessions. Not session-based amnesia."

## Expected Responses & Counters

### If They Say: "Apply through our careers site"
**Counter:** "I did. Job's been open 6 months. That tells me ATS isn't working for this role. 15-minute conversation will demonstrate more than any resume screening."

### If They Say: "Position has been filled"
**Counter:** "Understood. Are there similar AI infrastructure roles in Atlanta? I'm not looking for a job - I'm looking for the right architecture challenge."

### If They Say: "We're still evaluating candidates"
**Counter:** "6 months of evaluation suggests you haven't found what you're looking for. Live demo in 15 minutes. Let me show you what's possible."

### If They Say: "Send your resume"
**Counter:** "Already available: portfolio.complexsimplicityai.com/resume.html. But resumes don't demonstrate capability. Let me show you the running systems."
