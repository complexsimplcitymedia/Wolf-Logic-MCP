# Patent Application Draft - Wolf Ai Enterprises
**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Application Type:** Utility Patent (AI/Software Method)

---

## 1. PRIMARY APPLICATION TYPE: UTILITY PATENT

### Overview
A Utility Patent is classified as a "computer-implemented invention" and requires a utility patent to protect how it functions.

### Filing Requirements
- **Provisional Patent Application:** A "low-cost placeholder" to secure a filing date while the software is still in development (final US follows in a non-provisional application with 12 months)
- **Non-Provisional Patent Application:** The formal application that is examined by the USPTO to determine if the AI method is novel and non-obvious

## 2. CRITICAL FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AI (2025)

To successfully patent an AI method, the application must meet specific 2025 standards regarding technical merit and inventorship:

### Technical Character
The software must solve a technical problem using technical means (e.g., improving computer vision accuracy or reducing data processing latency).

**Our Technical Problem:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: Describe the specific technical problem your AI solution solves]

**Our Technical Solution:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: Describe how your invention solves this problem using technical means]

### Practical Application
Claims must go beyond abstract mathematical algorithms by integrating them into a practical use case.

**Our Practical Application:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: Describe how the AI method is applied to a real-world use case, not just abstract algorithms]

### Human Inventorship
Per current law (e.g., Thaler v. Vidal), only natural persons (humans) can be listed as inventors. AI-assisted inventors are patentable as long as a human made a "significant contribution" to the invention's conception.

**Named Inventors:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: List all human inventors who made significant contributions]

### Detailed Disclosure
The application must describe the AI architecture (layers, connectivity), training methodologies, and data requirements in enough detail for others to reproduce the results.

**System Architecture:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: Describe AI architecture - layers, connectivity, model structure]

**Training Methodology:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: Describe training process, datasets, optimization methods]

**Data Requirements:**
[TO BE COMPLETED: Describe input/output data formats, preprocessing requirements]
