Application Type: Utility Patent (AI/Software Method)


1. System Overview

The invention is a distributed AI execution architecture composed of multiple independent compute nodes (“agents”) that operate in parallel under a coordinating control layer.

Each node:

Executes AI tasks independently

Shares state through a controlled memory layer

Can join or leave the swarm dynamically

The system improves scalability, reliability, and performance over monolithic AI execution.



2. Nodes (What They Actually Are)

A node is any compute unit capable of executing AI logic, including:

Containers

Virtual machines

Physical hosts

Edge devices

Each node includes:

A local execution engine

A task interface

A communication module

Optional local memory or cache

👉 Key point: Nodes are interchangeable and heterogeneous.
That’s where novelty lives.put data formats, preprocessing requirements]

3. Swarm Coordinator (The Brain)

At least one coordination service:

Assigns tasks to nodes

Monitors node health

Rebalances workloads dynamically

Maintains system-wide state

This is not centralized control — it’s orchestration.

If a node fails:

Tasks are reassigned

System continues operating

That’s your reliability improvement.

4. Shared Memory / State Layer (The Glue)

The swarm uses a shared memory abstraction to:

Store intermediate AI outputs

Maintain execution context

Synchronize agent decisions

This memory may be:

Centralized

Distributed

Partitioned

Eventually consistent

The key is controlled access, not raw sharing.

This is what makes it a system, not a pile of workers.

5. Parallel AI Execution (The Technical Effect)

Instead of one model doing everything:

Multiple nodes run AI tasks concurrently

Outputs are aggregated

Decisions are refined collaboratively

Technical improvements include:

Reduced latency

Increased throughput

Fault tolerance

Adaptive scaling

These are patent-grade technical effects.
