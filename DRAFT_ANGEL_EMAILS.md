## Email 1: Naval Ravikant (@naval)

**To:** Find via LinkedIn/Twitter DM
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** AI with September memory - ChatGPT can't do this

Naval,

What did I ask you to remind me about last week?

(You're searching your memory right now. That's the problem.)

I built the solution. AI that remembers conversations from September - not just this session, but months ago. Word-for-word recall with timestamps.

**Launching Friday.** Production infrastructure deployed (pgai + Qdrant + Neo4j + Ollama). 88K memories vectorized. Mobile app ready.

Need $10K survival capital to execute the launch. 5% equity, YC SAFE note, 48-hour close.

You invested in Anthropic and Perplexity because you saw the AI memory problem. I solved it. Live demo available anytime next 48 hours.

Available for call: [PHONE]

P.S. - "$100 when you need it most > $10,000 when you don't." This is that moment.

## Email 2: Elad Gil (@eladgil)

**To:** Find via LinkedIn
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** Character.AI has personality. Mine has memory.

Elad,

You invested in Character.AI, Harvey.AI, Mistral. All impressive tech. None remember what you told them in September.

**Live demo:** "What did we discuss September 3rd?" [My AI answers with exact quote + timestamp]

That's not a feature. That's a fundamental shift in how AI works.

Launching Friday. Production stack deployed, mobile app approved, 88K memories operational. Need $10K to survive launch week - facing homelessness but won't sell the servers.

5% equity, YC SAFE, 48hr close.

You make fast decisions on compelling AI tech. This is compelling. Call me in the next 48 hours.

## Email 3: Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder)

**To:** Find via LinkedIn
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** LinkedIn's founder knows: professionals need AI that remembers

Reid,

You built LinkedIn because professionals needed persistent context across interactions. Every connection, every message, searchable history.

Now they use ChatGPT for work. And it forgets yesterday's conversation.

I fixed that. AI-powered job search app with true persistent memory. Semantic search across 88K+ memories. "What did we discuss early September?" gets exact answers with timestamps.

**Launching Friday.** Not asking for development capital - product is built. Asking for $10K survival capital to execute the launch.

5% equity, $200K valuation (negotiable up), YC SAFE note, 48hr close.

Your investment thesis: "AI that amplifies human potential." Memory is the foundation of human potential. Mine works.

## Email 4: Allie K Miller (support@alliekmiller.com)

**To:** support@alliekmiller.com
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** B2B AI/ML with memory - pre-seed ask

Allie,

B2B AI/ML startup, pre-seed stage, launching Friday.

**What I built:** AI-powered job search with persistent memory across sessions. ChatGPT forgets yesterday. Mine remembers September.

**Tech stack:**
- 88K+ memories, 2560-dim embeddings (qwen3-embedding:4b)
- Production: Qdrant, Neo4j, PostgreSQL/pgai, Ollama
- Mobile app (React Native) - approved, launch-ready

**The ask:** $10K survival capital. Facing homelessness, need to make it through launch week. 5% equity, YC SAFE note.

**Why now:** Product built (10,000 hours invested). Not funding development - funding survival through launch.

You invested in Replit, Hebbia, Hyperwrite. Companies building real tech. This is real tech. Demo available anytime next 48 hours.

## Email 5: Paul Buchheit (Gmail creator)

**To:** Find via Twitter @paultoo
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** You built Gmail to remember emails. I built AI to remember conversations.

Paul,

You know the power of searchable history. Gmail made email useful by making it searchable and persistent.

AI doesn't have that yet. ChatGPT forgets last week. Anthropic forgets yesterday. Users lose context constantly.

I solved it. AI with semantic search across months of conversation history. "Early September we discussed X" returns exact quotes with timestamps.

Launching Friday. Mobile app for job search, but the memory system is the real innovation. 88K+ memories operational, sub-second retrieval.

Need $10K to survive launch week. 5% equity, YC SAFE, 48hr close.

You co-founded YC. You know what real tech looks like. Live demo available - call me in next 48 hours.

## Email 6: Justin Kan (Twitch co-founder)

**To:** Find via Twitter @justinkan / LinkedIn
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** Twitch scaled live interaction. I'm scaling AI memory.

Justin,

You built Twitch knowing that real-time interaction needed persistent context (chat logs, follower history, stream archives).

AI needs the same thing. ChatGPT has live interaction but zero persistent memory. Users lose context between sessions.

I built the archive layer for AI. Semantic search across months of conversation. Mobile job search app launching Friday.

Just invested $20M pre-seed in Wabi. Here's a tighter deal: $10K for 5% of a product that's already built and launching in 3 days.

YC SAFE note, 48hr close. Available for demo anytime next 48 hours.

## Email 7: Garry Tan (YC CEO)

**To:** Find via Twitter @garrytan
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** YC SAFE note ready. Launching Friday. Survival capital, not dev capital.

Garry,

Most founders pitch YC with an idea and a prototype. I'm pitching with:
- Working product (launches Friday)
- Patent filed (IP protected)
- Production infrastructure (88K memories, full stack deployed)
- 10,000 hours invested

**The differentiator:** True persistent memory. AI that remembers conversations from September with word-for-word recall and timestamps.

Need $10K to survive launch week (facing homelessness). 5% equity, YC SAFE note, 48hr close.

Not asking you to fund development. Development is done. Asking you to fund survival through a launch that happens in 72 hours.

Demo available: [PHONE]

## Email 8: Sarah Guo (Conviction VC)

**To:** Find via Twitter @saranormous / LinkedIn
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** pgai + Qdrant + Neo4j + Ollama. Production AI memory stack. Launching Friday.

Sarah,

You left Greylock to start an AI-focused fund because you saw where the market was going.

Here's where it's going: AI with persistent memory. Not sessions. Not conversations. Months of semantic search across full context.

**My stack:**
- PostgreSQL with pgai (vector storage + semantic search)
- Qdrant (vector DB, 88K+ embeddings)
- Neo4j (knowledge graph)
- Ollama (qwen3-embedding:4b, 2560 dims, #1 MTEB multilingual)

Mobile job search app. Launches Friday. Need $10K survival capital. 5% equity, YC SAFE, 48hr close.

You invest in AI infrastructure and application layer. This is both. Demo available next 48 hours.

## Email 9: Edward Lando (Pareto Holdings)

**To:** Find via LinkedIn
**From:** admin@complexsimplicityai.com
**Subject:** AI for global remote workers. Your portfolio companies hire - mine finds talent.

Edward,

You invested in Ramp, Deel, Eight Sleep, Remote. Companies building infrastructure for distributed work.

I'm building AI for the job seekers on the other side of that equation. AI-powered job search targeting global remote workers, with memory that persists across months of conversation.

**The angle:** Your portfolio companies need talent. My users are looking for remote jobs at companies exactly like yours.

Launching Friday. $10K for 5% equity. YC SAFE note, 48hr close.

200+ companies since 2016. You know how to spot infrastructure plays. This is one. Demo available.
