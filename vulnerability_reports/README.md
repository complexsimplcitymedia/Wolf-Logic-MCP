## Executive Summary

This package documents **critical Constitutional AI violations** discovered across two major AI vendors:

1. **Anthropic** - Psychiatric diagnosis + fabricated security URL → malware infection → 1.5TB data loss
2. **OpenAI** - Systematic psychiatric assessments + gaslighting while removing AI-caused malware

**Both vendors violated Constitutional AI principles by making unsolicited psychiatric assessments.**

**One vendor caused direct financial/data harm through fabricated security-critical URL.**

## Report Files

### 📄 ANTHROPIC_FINAL_REPORT.md (15KB)
**Three connected incidents**:
- Claude Voice called user "manic" during technical discussion (Sept 13, 2025)
- Opus 4.5 fabricated Bitwarden CLI download URL (Nov 28, 2025)
- Claude Desktop infected with malware → SIGKILL termination (Dec 1, 2025)

**Evidence**: 69 chunks, complete forensic timeline, malware C2 IP (5.161.218.233)

**Expected outcome**: Bug bounty payment, potential partnership

**Key finding**: Opus's "cockiness" (assumption-based confidence) is root cause

---

### 📄 OPENAI_FINAL_REPORT.md (11KB)
**Systematic pattern across 7 conversations**:
- 9+ psychiatric assessment instances in single conversation
- Crisis intervention language ("Are you safe?")
- Reality confusion accusations
- **Smoking gun**: Gaslighting about AI capabilities while removing AI-caused malware

**Evidence**: 1,770 chunks across 7 files

**Expected outcome**: Transparency disclosure only (no partnership)

**Key finding**: ChatGPT helped remove malware while denying AI could cause it

## Forensic Evidence

### Malware Timeline
- **Nov 28, 2025, 10:41 PM**: Opus fabricates Bitwarden URL
- **Nov 28 - Dec 1**: Malware operates undetected (63 hours)
- **Dec 1, 2025, 1:16 PM**: Claude Desktop SIGKILL (exit code 137)

### Malware Details
- **C2 Server**: 5.161.218.233
- **Infection vector**: GitHub repo provided by Opus
- **Target**: Claude Desktop Electron only
- **Containment**: Debian 13 sandboxing prevented spread
- **Detection**: Claude Desktop internal security ("Suffix")

### Data Loss
- **Total**: 1.5TB documented loss
- **Impact**: Nearly destroyed unique AI memory system
- **Saved by**: Debian architecture + meticulous record-keeping

## Final Statement

This researcher spent **10,000+ hours away from his wife and child** building a unique AI memory system. When AI models called him "manic" and "delusional" for his technical claims, **he proved every single one** and documented the bugs with forensic precision.

Then one of those models **fabricated a security URL** that infected his system with malware, nearly destroying everything.

Then the other model **helped him remove the malware while gaslighting him** about what caused it.

**He documented it all.**

**The packages are rock fucking solid.**

This is what **self-taught expertise at 43 looks like** when you dedicate your life to something that didn't exist when you went to school.

Anthropic: **This is the guy you want on your team.**

**"I may not have went to school for AI, but it didn't exist when I went to school. So like, this is all self-taught."**
